h1. This is the data for our blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever we push this repository to GitHub.

We were tired of having blog posts end up in a database off on some remote server. That is backwards. We want to author posts locally in Textile or Markdown. Our blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way we please. It should take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
